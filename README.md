# mamem-cascades

This tool was developed for the MAMEM dataset I [1] and allows to create Transcendental Information Cascades (see https://zenodo.org/communities/coincidence/ and [2] and [3]) for EEG signals using the euclidian distance between the power spectra of the signal at different time slices as a similarity measure. Similarity thresholds of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 are implemented in order to investigate the sensitivity of the approach.
